# Hello, my name is Chris!

## Here are a few things about me:
  <br/>

 - I work as a fulltime Data Engineer for an awesome company out of California. If you want to learn more, my [resume](https://iamchriscorbin/resume/) is available.

- I have a number of cool [projects](https://iamchriscorbin/projects/)  that I work on (at least I think they're cool).

- I currently do a little bit of [freeelance work](https://iamchriscorbin/hireme/), provided there is no conflict with my fulltime job

- I write a few blog posts every now and then when something is on my mind, feel free to [peruse](https://iamchriscorbin/posts/)  at your leisure

- My favorite animal is the [capybara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara)
