Here are a few fun facts about me:
=====
  <br/>

 - I work as a fulltime Data Engineer. If you want to learn more, my [resume](/resume/) is available.

- I have a number of cool [projects](/projects/)  that I work on (at least I think they're cool).

- I currently do a little bit of [freeelance work](/hireme/), provided there is no conflict with my fulltime job.

- I write a few blog posts every now and then when something is on my mind, feel free to [peruse](/posts/)  at your leisure.

- My favorite animal is the [capybara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara).
