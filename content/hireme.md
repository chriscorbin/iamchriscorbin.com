# Need some help?

I may be able to assist. I take on some freelance work every now and then and would be glad to try and help if I can as long as there is no conflict with my fulltime job.

If you are interested, please drop me an [email](mailto:christopheracorbin@outlook.com)

## Just some assistance I can offer:

**Database Administration**
- Database design and modeling
- Query writing and optimization
- Performance and operational troubleshooting

**Data Engineering**
- API Interaction
- ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) from flat data sources into a database
- Export of database elements to flat files 
- Data Warehouse design and deployment

**Business Intelligence / Analytics** 
- Tableau Workbook design and creation
- PowerBI Dashboard design and creation

**Process Automation**
- Webscraping
- File transfer management and reporting
- Automated alerts and emails


## F.A.Q.s:

- What is your hourly rate?
-- Depends on what the job is, drop me an email and I would be happy to discuss scope/rates prior to starting work and I can work within most budgets.

- Do you do mobile apps? -- Not right now, there are tons of mobile devs out there that are much more experienced with iOS or Android than I am.
